# 🧩 Builder of Systems, Breaker of Bottlenecks

I design systems that scale, automate what hurts, and ship fast — without breaking things.

Currently crafting products in stealth mode, blending **system architecture**, **mobile**, and **AI/LLM integration**. I believe the best tools disappear into the background and the best teams run on trust, clarity, and clean interfaces — both human and machine.

## 🛠 What I’m Good At

### 💡 Full-Stack, But With Systems Intuition

- React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Kubernetes — built it, deployed it, broke it, fixed it
- CI/CD and internal tooling so devs can stop yelling at Jenkins
- From mobile apps to enterprise-grade infrastructure — shipped, scaled, and slept well

### 🧠 Practical AI — Not Hype, Just Utility

- Embedding LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) into real-world tools
- RAG pipelines, prompt tuning, internal chatbots — all about removing human friction
- AI isn’t replacing developers — but bad ones should be worried

### ✍️ Think Clearly, Build Cleanly

- Write to understand, code to express
- Occasionally drop thoughts on [this blog](https://thanhtunguet.info) — when caffeine hits clarity
- If it’s worth building, it’s worth explaining well

## 🔍 What I'm Exploring

> Bringing automation and LLMs to places that still run on spreadsheets and PDFs.

Currently leading engineering at an early-stage venture in Vietnam. My focus:  
- Architecting scalable systems from scratch  
- Mentoring devs to not need mentoring  
- Injecting AI into workflows where it actually helps

## ☕️ Come Say Hi (or Don’t)

Interested in:
- Real-world use of LLMs
- Engineering culture that doesn’t suck
- Trading war stories over coffee (Hanoi or online)
