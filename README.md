👋 Hi, I’m Pham Thanh Tung — Engineer | Builder | Startup Co-founder

I’m a full-stack product engineer with a strong foundation in system architecture, DevOps, and cross-platform mobile development. Over the past years, I’ve helped build scalable, real-world systems — from anonymous chatbots to IoT solutions — and recently, I’m exploring how Generative AI can supercharge product delivery in early-stage startups.

I’m currently a co-founder and tech lead at a startup in Hanoi, where I combine technical leadership, team mentoring, and hands-on development to bring products from zero to one.
